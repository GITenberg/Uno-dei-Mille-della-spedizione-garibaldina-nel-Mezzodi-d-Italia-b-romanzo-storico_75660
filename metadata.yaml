summary: '"Uno dei Mille della Spedizione Garibaldina nel Mezzodì d''Italia" by Vittore
  Ottolini is a historical novel written in the mid-19th century. The narrative revolves
  around the life and adventures of Roberto, a young painter who finds himself drawn
  into the events surrounding Giuseppe Garibaldi''s campaign in Italy. The book explores
  themes of love, patriotism, and the struggles faced by individuals amid the turmoil
  of their time.  The opening of the novel introduces Roberto as he arrives at an
  inn in Albese, hungry and eager to savor the beauty of the Italian countryside.
  He reflects on his aspirations, dreams of a pastoral life, and his worries about
  a beloved named Dalia, an orphaned girl he cares for. As Roberto admires the stunning
  panorama around him, he yearns to escape the confines of his artistic routine in
  Milan and imagines a rustic life filled with friendship and joy. However, the arrival
  of a letter changes the course of his thoughts, drawing him back into the reality
  of a world facing significant change, hinting at the adventure that lies ahead.
